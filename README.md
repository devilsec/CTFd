# DevilSec CTFd Fork


Welcome to DevilSec's CTFd fork.

This is a fork of CTFd which is kept up to date with each CTFd release and is used to contain the various plugins and configurations that we at DevilSec use in our CTF infrastructure.

Paired with an installation script, this allows for the very rapid deployment and setup of our CTF infrastructure with everything from our plugins to configurations present.
